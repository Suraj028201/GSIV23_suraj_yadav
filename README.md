-- i have integrated upcoming movie api as well as search api.
-- i have also added pagination with next and previous button
-- one thing i could have done is that when user comes back from details page, it shuld have landed on the same page from which he went to the details page
-- all the functionality is working fine, list of upcoming movie, in recent sorted release date is coming, you ca search movie by name, pagination is also working fine as well as routing.
